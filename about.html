## About

Hi my name is Chyi and I'm a web developer from Seattle, WA.  I've always been intrigued by computers and technology, but unlike most I discovered my love for programming later in life.  After touring with my band for 4 years I obtained my bachelors in IT.  It was through my work with databases that I discovered how fun it was to build things.  In 2015 I decided to leave my job and pursue my passion - which leads me to today.  My area of expertise lies in full-stack developement - specifically using Node and JavaScript frameworks; however, I'm experienced in a wide array of web technologies and believe a good developer shouldn't be measured on technology one knows, but the ability to learn.
